Project Description: Setting Up a Windows OS Honeypot on Azure with Microsoft Sentinel

Overview

This project involves creating a Windows OS honeypot on Microsoft Azure to detect and analyze malicious activities. 
A honeypot is a security mechanism designed to attract attackers and study their behavior. By integrating the honeypot
with Azure's monitoring and security tools, we can gain valuable insights into potential security threats and respond to them effectively.

Objectives

Deploy a Windows OS honeypot on Azure: Set up a virtual machine (VM) that mimics a typical Windows environment to lure attackers.
Collect and analyze logs: Use Azure Log Analytics to collect and analyze logs generated by the honeypot.
Monitor with Microsoft Sentinel: Integrate the log data with Microsoft Sentinel to set up advanced threat detection and response capabilities.
Automate alerting and response: Create analytic rules and configure alerts to automatically notify and respond to suspicious activities.
